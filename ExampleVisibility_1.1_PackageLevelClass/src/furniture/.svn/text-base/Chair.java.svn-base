 * We declare class Chair without any modifier.
 * Similar to the case of attribute and methods,
 * not having a modifier means that the class Chair
 * is only accessible (i.e., importable) within its
 * resident package. 
 * Notice that you can only declare a class
 * 	- as public (project-level access)
 * 	- without any modifier (package-level access)
 * It is NOT allowed to declare a class as 'private'!
